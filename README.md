# Tic-Tac-Toe
A fully functional Tic Tac Toe game that I developed as a fun coding exercise. 🚀

🌟 Features:

Two-player mode (X and O)
Dynamic UI updates for current player
Win detection for both players
Game tie detection
New game button to start fresh 

👨‍💻 Key Takeaways:

HTML for structuring the game grid and buttons.
CSS for styling and animations, including highlighting the winning combination.
JavaScript for game logic, player turns, and win/tie detection.

💡 What I Learned:

Event listeners for handling player clicks.
Conditional statements to check for wins and ties.
Array manipulation for game grid management.
And more!
